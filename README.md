# Hello-World
First ever repo. Hopefully, first of many, trying out this new carreer for my life. I hope I'm happier at this than what I'm trying to do rn. If it really, really works, and I leave my current carreer behind, I'll make a program dedicated to people facing difficulty in life searching for carreers.
I'm thinking of, basically, one that analyzes psychological, cultural and economical choices to return an opinion or fact.
We'll see, future Ulisses. We'll see.
